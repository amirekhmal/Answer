•	Front-end language

o	The platform for online restaurant reservation is website and the front-end language that I choose are HTML and JavaScript .

o	The reason why use HTML is most of the browsers  around the world support HTML rather than other web programming 
  as long as we take care to optimize the website compatibility. 

o	Then, reason why  use JavaScript is it has user interface interactivity such as form validation for 
  user to input their details for reservation, it can give alert by using alert box to warning user about 
  missing or invalid fields in form.Furthermore, JavaScript also can use in scheduling which is for make 
  a reservation either it is available or not in that date and time.

•	Back-end language

o	For back-end language, I choose PHP because of it easy to manage and store the data into database 
  for staff to view. For example, we can use PHP to load reservation details from database to staff page or 
  website to know at what time and date that book by their customer. Other than that, it can use to fill a form 
  such as feedback that can be combine with HTML language to make it easier to load and store to database.

•	Database management system

o	For database management system, I choose MySQL because of it free and open-source database management system and 
  also easy to set up in Linux, Unix and Windows. MySQL also offer security features that ensure data protection and 
  its also provides mechanisms for ensure the authorizes users have entry to the database. For example, only manager or senior staff 
  can access to see the details of their customer and the reservations. Furthermore, MySQL offers main memory tables for fast 
  response time which is it deliver high-speed disk table rather than standard disk table.
